Hi

There is a bug in the settings for the tabs which show top right in the editor.
I have found it in two of my eight joomla sites - do not want to mess the other six !!!

If the Editor Toggle Label is set, then the "code" tab disappears
If the Preview Tab is set to off, then the "code" tab disappears

It does not seem possible to restore the status quo
Re-enabling the Preview Tab restores it, but NOT the "code" tab

However the on/off icon at the top left of the editor id unaffected.

I comment that having two ways to do the same thing is never a good idea
